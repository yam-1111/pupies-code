# V activities

Here's my V implementation of the codes, just for fun nothing to serious, probably will not focus on this language.


## Vlang behavior and methods

### If / Else

Vlang doesn't use `if(expr){}` but rather `if expr {}` similar in python style

### Variable assignment

In vlang mutable variables are declared as `mut <variable_name> := <value>`

changing the element in vlang is `<variable_name> = <value`

### F string style
vlang uses `${<variable_name} to format on println`
